# Hello World!

After you have learnt how to use the executable go to the directory that you want to make your first program in, create a file with a `.n` extension (preferrably `run.n` but it can be a different name) then add the following code there

```js
print("Hello World!")
```

Here `print` is an internal function that will display out any value put into it, here it will output `Hello World!`. Run it using the executable using either `n` if your file is named `run.n` or `n --file [file name]` if your file is named anything else, if you want to check for errors you can add `--check` at the end.

Congratulations on making your first N program now you can check out the [features list](./feature_list.md) for more advanced programs
