# Variables

```js
// Declare a string that has the value "test"
let test:str = "test"

// Types can be inferred
let test2 = 1

print(test)
print(test2)

// You can change the values of varaiables, but this is discouraged
var test = "hi"

print(test)
```

## Notes:
- `var` does not need a type after the name
- `type` was used to get the type of a variable but is now depricated.
