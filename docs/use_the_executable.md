# Using the executable

Congradulations on installing N! Now it is time to understand more about it.

If you want a quick and concise tutorial on how to use the executable simply run `n --help` and it will give you a short description of each option, here this will go into more detail.

- `--help or -h`: Shows the help menu with short descriptions of each of the options
- `--file`: If this is left out then this will run `run.n` but if it is here then it will run the file name that is put after (The file extension is required)
- `--check`: This will only run the compile-time part of the program showing both warnings and errors but not running the code

Now that you understand this, go to the directory you wish to have your program in create a `.n` file (preferrably `run.n`) and start on [Hello World!](./hello_world.md)
