# Why use N?
N is a strongly typed programming language that is similar to javascript with a few differences,
- It was made to be strongly typed
- You can either compile or interpret it based on what you want
- It is very easy to change what functions do as they are all variables
- It has many features that work with currying

N is very easy to set up, just follow the [Install Instructions](https://github.com/nbuilding/N-lang#install-n) for your operating system and type `n --help` to verify that it works, after you have verified that it works, start on [setting up the development environment](./set_up_environment.md)
