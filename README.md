[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and
[Nearley](https://nearley.js.org/).

See how to run it in the [js/ folder](./js/README.md).

## Web editor

An IDE is available at https://nbuilding.github.io/N-lang/. It uses the JS

editor used in VSCode. The code for the editor is available in the [web/
